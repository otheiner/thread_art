# StringArt class

This is the repository of my little coding and crafting project. I created class that turns any picture into a cring art on circular frame with defined number of nails. Not all images are suitable for this - the picture that usually works best are pictures that has high contrast, not so many sharp edges. Faces and animals tend to work well. Landscapes, buiodings and similar things usually don't. 

The class itself is in a string_art.py file and notebook tutorial.ipynb demonstrates the basic functionality.
